# Word-Guessing-Game

Using JavaScript's OOP (Object-Oriented Programming), and DOM Manipulation to create a random, hidden phrase game, the player tries to guess by clicking letters on an onscreen keyboard. From a list of 5 pre-chosen phrases, the player will be given a new random phrase each time they play.

Added a color background around the phrase when the phrase is guessed correctly before resetting the game to give players a chance to read the phrase.


### Guidelines for the Game:

1. At the beginning, the player clicks on the "Start Game" button and only sees the number of letters and words in the phrase, represented by blank boxes on the screen.

2. The player clicks an onscreen keyboard to guess letters in the phrase.

3. The letter is disabled on the onscreen keyboard and a player can't select that letter again.

4. If the selected letter is in the phrase at least once, the letter and its position in the phrase is highlighted on screen. All instances of the letter are made visible (so if there are 3 A's, all of the A's in the phrase appear at once).

5. If the selected letter is not in the phrase, one of the player's hearts in the scoreboard is changed from a "live" heart to a "lost" heart. The player keeps choosing letters until they reveal all the letters in the phrase, or they make five incorrect guesses.

6. A player continues to select letters until they guess the phrase (and win), or make five incorrect guesses (and lose). If the player completes the phrase before they run out of guesses, a winning screen appears. If the player guesses incorrectly five times, a losing screen appears.

7. After the game is over, player may click "Start Game" button to play a new game.
